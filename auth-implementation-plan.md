# Auth Flow Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ Completed Components:
- **Auth Domain**: Complete with JWT, multi-tenant access, role-based permissions
- **Customer Domain**: Complete with CRUD, tenant isolation, caching
- **Database Infrastructure**: 4 databases (auth, longbeach, bakersfield, colorado)
- **Enhanced User Tool**: Can create bootstrap admin with multi-tenant access

### ❌ Identified Issues:
- **Service Interface Mismatch**: `auth.NewAuthService()` vs `auth.NewService()`
- **Missing Admin Application**: Need multi-tenant admin interface
- **Incomplete Auth Flow**: Login/logout not fully integrated

## Proposed User Roles & Workflow

### Role Hierarchy:
1. **`super-admin`** (system-wide): Access all tenants, create tenant admins
2. **`admin`** (tenant-specific): Manage users/customers within assigned tenant(s)
3. **`customer_manager`** (tenant-specific): Manage customer data, relationships
4. **`customer_contact`** (customer-specific): View/edit only their customer data

## Recommended Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation (Critical)
1. ✅ **Create bootstrap super-admin** ← **START HERE**
2. Fix auth service interface mismatches
3. Build unified admin application (not location-specific)

### Phase 2: Auth Integration
4. Implement complete login/logout flow
5. Test multi-tenant authentication
6. Validate role-based access controls

### Phase 3: Admin Features
7. Admin dashboard with tenant switching
8. Customer CRUD operations per tenant
9. User management (create tenant admins, customer managers)

### Phase 4: Customer Management
10. Customer contact management
11. Customer-specific access controls

## Questions for You

1. **Application Architecture**: Should we build one unified admin app that handles all tenants, or keep the location-specific apps (longbeach, bakersfield, colorado)?

2. **User Management Scope**: For tenant admins created by super-admin, should they have:
   - Single tenant access (admin only for "longbeach")
   - Multi-tenant access (admin for multiple locations)

3. **Customer Manager Role**: Should customer managers:
   - Manage all customers in their assigned tenant(s)?
   - Be assigned to specific customers only?

## My Recommendations

**Primary Recommendation**: Start with creating the bootstrap super-admin, then build a unified admin application. This gives us the most flexibility and matches your multi-tenant architecture.

**Architecture Approach**:
- Build one unified admin application that can switch between tenants
- Keep location-specific apps for operational staff (operators, managers)
- Super-admin and tenant admins use the unified admin interface
- Customer contacts use tenant-specific applications

**User Management Approach**:
- Tenant admins should have flexible access (can be assigned single or multiple tenants)
- Customer managers manage all customers in their assigned tenant(s) by default
- Fine-grained customer assignment can be added later if needed

## Next Steps
1. Create bootstrap super-admin using enhanced user tool
2. Fix service interface mismatches in auth domain
3. Build unified admin application with tenant switching capability
